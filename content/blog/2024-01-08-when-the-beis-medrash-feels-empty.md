There's a particular kind of loneliness that happens in a crowded beis medrash. You're surrounded by the sounds of Torah - the hum of chavrusos, the rhythm of gemara, the occasional burst of excited discovery. But inside, you're screaming, and no one can hear.

I've sat there, ostensibly learning, but really just turning pages while my mind spirals. Anxiety about parnassah. Depression that makes every daf feel like climbing a mountain. Questions about emunah that feel too dangerous to voice.

The yeshiva world taught me to learn, to daven, to grow. But it didn't teach me what to do when my brain chemistry makes all of that feel impossible. It didn't teach me that needing therapy isn't a weakness. That medication isn't a failure of bitachon.

I wish someone had told me earlier: Hashem created you with a neshama AND a brain. Sometimes the brain needs fixing just like any other organ. There's no contradiction between complete emunah and taking an SSRI. Between davening with kavanah and going to therapy.

You can be a ben Torah and struggle with mental health. These aren't opposites. They're both parts of the same person - you, with all your complexity, trying to serve Hashem with the tools you have.

If you're that person in the beis medrash feeling alone right now: you're not alone. There are more of us than you think. And getting help isn't giving up on ruchniyus - it's honoring the person Hashem created you to be.
