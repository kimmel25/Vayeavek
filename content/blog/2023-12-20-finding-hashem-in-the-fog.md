I used to feel Hashem when I davened. Not every time, but enough to know there was Someone listening. I used to feel inspired by a good vort, moved by a beautiful niggun. I used to feel something.

Then, slowly, it all went gray. Depression crept in like fog, and suddenly I was just going through motions. Davening words I didn't feel. Learning words I couldn't connect to. The beis medrash that used to feel like home felt like a theater where I was performing a role.

I thought maybe I'd done something wrong. Maybe this was punishment. Maybe I'd lost my chelek in ruchniyus. The guilt was crushing.

It took me too long to realize: depression is an illness, not a spiritual failure. When your brain chemistry is off, feeling emotions - including spiritual emotions - becomes nearly impossible. It's not that Hashem left. It's that the instrument you use to perceive Him is temporarily broken.

Here's what helped me: I kept showing up. Even when I felt nothing. Even when it felt fake. I davened the words even when they felt empty. I learned even when it felt mechanical.

And slowly - not all at once, not linearly, but slowly - the fog started to lift. Not because I davened myself out of depression. But because I got help. Real help. Therapy. Medication. Support.

And as my brain healed, I started to feel again. Not the same as before - I'm different now. But real. Authentic.

The greatest lie depression tells you is that it's permanent. That this is just who you are now. It's not true. There's a path through the fog.

You just have to keep walking.
