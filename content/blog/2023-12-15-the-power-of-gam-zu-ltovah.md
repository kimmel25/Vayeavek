We know the story: Nachum Ish Gam Zu would respond to everything with "Gam zu l'tovah" - this too is for the good. Even when terrible things happened, he saw good.

It's easy to read this as toxic positivity. Just smile through the pain! Everything happens for a reason! It's all good!

But that's not what Nachum was saying. The Sfas Emes points out something crucial: he didn't say "Zeh tov" - this IS good. He said "Gam zu L'tovah" - this too is FOR good. Meaning: this will lead to good. This will transform into good.

That's profoundly different. It's not denying that something is painful or difficult or even tragic. It's expressing faith that Hashem can work even with - especially with - brokenness.

When you're struggling with mental health, people sometimes quote this at you as if it should make you feel better. "It's all good! Hashem has a plan!" And it feels dismissive, like they're minimizing your pain.

But the deeper understanding is this: Yes, what you're going through is hard. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's real suffering. AND - Hashem can work with this. Your struggle isn't wasted. It's being transformed, in ways you might not see yet, into something that will be for good.

Not despite your pain. Through it.

That's not toxic positivity. That's faith. Faith that even dust can rise to the Kisei HaKavod.
