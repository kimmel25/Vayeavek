The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 77:3) teaches us something remarkable: When Yaakov Avinu wrestled with the Sar shel Eisav, their struggle was so intense that the dust they raised ascended all the way to the Kisei HaKavod - the Throne of Glory.

Think about that image. Dust. The lowest thing, kicked up from the ground, covering the highest spiritual reality.

The Sefas Emes explains that this teaches us a fundamental truth: our struggles down here in this world are not separate from the spiritual realm above. When we wrestle with our yetzer hara, with our doubts, with our pain - that struggle itself creates a connection upward.

But here's the paradox: the dust covers the Kisei. It obscures. When we're in the midst of struggle, we can't see the connection. We can't see how our pain and our questions fit into any divine plan. The dust blocks our vision.

Yet the very fact that the dust reaches the Kisei means the connection exists. Our struggles matter. They register in the highest realms. Even when - especially when - we can't see it.

Yaakov limped away from that struggle. He was wounded. But he was also transformed. He became Yisrael - the one who struggled with the divine and prevailed.

Your struggle is not evidence of failure. It's evidence of engagement with something real, something that matters enough to fight over.
