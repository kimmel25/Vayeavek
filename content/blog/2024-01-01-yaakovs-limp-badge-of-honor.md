After the struggle, the Torah tells us "Vayizrach lo hashemesh" - the sun rose for him. Rashi says this sun rose specifically to heal him. Yet we know that Yaakov walked with a limp for the rest of his life.

So which is it? Was he healed or wasn't he?

The Nesivos Shalom explains beautifully: The physical injury was healed. But Yaakov chose to keep the limp. It became part of who he was - Yisrael, the one who struggled.

Think about what that means. After everything, after the healing was available, he integrated the struggle into his very identity. The limp wasn't a failure to heal completely. It was a reminder. A testimony.

In our own lives, we sometimes expect that healing means erasing all traces of what we went through. That if we're really better, really growing, we should be able to move past our struggles without any lasting effects.

But maybe that's not how it works. Maybe healing means integrating our struggles into who we are. Acknowledging that yes, we wrestled with something difficult. Yes, it left a mark. And that mark is part of our story.

Yaakov didn't become Yisrael by pretending the struggle never happened. He became Yisrael by walking forward, limp and all, into his destiny.

Your scars - emotional, spiritual, mental - they're not disqualifications. They're part of your testimony. You're still here. Still walking. Still trying.

That's not weakness. That's Yisrael.
